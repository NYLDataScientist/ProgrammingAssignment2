## Below are two functions that are used to create a special object that stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix",
## which is really a list containing a function to do the following four tasks:

## (1) set the value of the matrix
## (2) get the value of the matrix
## (3) set the value of the inverse 
## (4) get the value of the inverse 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    inverse <- NULL
    set <- function(y){
        x <<- y
        inverse <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(solve) inverse <<- solve
    getinverse <- function() inverse
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setinverse = setinverse,
         getinverse = getinverse)
    
}

## The following function cacheSolve calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    inverse <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(inverse)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(inverse)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    inverse <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(inverse)
    inverse
}
